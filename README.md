# Mandala  
A game created for a Latitude 53 exhibition.  

The Mandala game is a meditative game where you are a point and the goal is to gather shapes around you. Once gathered, a shape will multiply and rotate around the layer. The user is encouraged to find their own mandala forms and sense of beauty.
